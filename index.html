  <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Parishi (she/her) ðŸŒ¸</h1>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m a sophomore at <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong> studying Information Systems, 
    with plans to minor in Software Engineering and Business. 
  </p>

  <p>
    My passion lies in making technology more accessible, intuitive, and human. 
    At the heart of my work is a simple mission: 
    <span class="highlight">to design tools that remove barriers, empower people of all abilities, 
    and ensure no one feels left behind by technology.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    My core valuesâ€”<strong>accessibility, empathy, and clarity</strong>â€”shape everything I create. 
    Whatever Iâ€™m building, I design with the belief that technology should support, not exclude.
