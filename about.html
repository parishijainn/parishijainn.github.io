      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I’m a first-generation American, born in Santa Monica to immigrant parents from India. 
        Their resilience and support shaped my belief in education, persistence, and inclusivity. 
        Today, I’m a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon studying Information Systems, 
        passionate about building technology that empowers, connects, and includes.

        <h2>Core Values</h2>
        <p>
          I always want people to feel comfortable and supported, whether in a classroom, workplace, or digital space. 
          I believe technology should remove barriers, not create them. My values—<strong>empathy, inclusivity, and clarity</strong>—
          shape how I design, live, and interact with others. They are the compass for my work and life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Women in STEM</h2>
        <p>
          Being a woman in a traditionally male-dominated field has shaped how I see 
          technology and community. My mom, a software engineer, has always been my 
          role model—showing me that persistence and passion matter more than stereotypes. 
          She taught me that being a woman is not a limitation but a strength. At the same 
          time, growing up with my brother, who has special needs, has deepened my belief 
          that technology should adapt to people, not the other way around. These experiences 
          ground my commitment to building tools that foster inclusion, empower underrepresented 
          voices, and ensure that no one feels left out in the future of tech.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Identity & Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          Being a woman in a male-dominated field, a first-generation American, and part of a multicultural family 
          gives me a perspective grounded in resilience and empathy. I know what it feels like to be in environments 
          without representation, and I am committed to shaping spaces where diversity and belonging are the norm.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Dance</h2>
        <p>
          I started Indian dance at age four and specialize in <strong>Kathak</strong>. 
          I am certified to teach 3 of 5 levels and plan to continue pursuing certifications. 
          Dance grounds me in discipline, creativity, and storytelling—it’s a lifelong way I stay connected to culture.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Ultimately, my goal is to help shape a future where technology feels personal, empowering, 
        and inclusive—where no one is left behind regardless of their abilities or background.
