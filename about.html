      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>I’m a first-generation American, born in Santa Monica and raised in California. My parents immigrated from India to give my siblings and me better opportunities, and their belief in me has shaped who I am today. Growing up on the West Coast, I dreamed of experiencing something different — which brought me to Carnegie Mellon on the East Coast. I’m now a sophomore studying Information Systems, planning to minor in Software Engineering and Business, and passionate about building technology that makes a positive impact on people’s lives.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Family & Inspiration</h2>
        <p>My parents are my biggest supporters, constantly reminding me to be confident and persistent. I have two younger brothers, one of whom is nonverbal and on the autism spectrum. Watching him navigate daily challenges has motivated me to advocate for inclusive technology — whether that’s systems that improve communication, learning, or collaboration. He inspires me every day to build tools that make technology more accessible for all.</p>

        <h2>Women in STEM</h2>
        <p>As a woman in STEM, I know how important representation and community are. I actively seek out opportunities to connect with and support other women in tech. My hope is to help create a future where technology is not only innovative but also inclusive — designed by diverse voices and accessible to everyone.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Dance</h2>
        <p>I’ve been dancing my whole life, staying connected to my Indian culture through classical and contemporary styles. Dance has taught me discipline, creativity, and resilience — lessons that extend far beyond the stage and into my academic and personal life.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Tennis</h2>
        <p>Since middle school, I’ve played tennis and even competed on my high school’s varsity girls team. Tennis gave me an appreciation for both individual practice and teamwork, and it continues to remind me that persistence and hard work always pay off.</p>
      </div>

      <p>At the heart of everything I do — whether it’s coding, research, or creative projects — is the belief that technology should help people. I want to keep building systems that empower, connect, and include, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
