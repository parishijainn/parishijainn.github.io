    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’ve always been passionate about creating technology that benefits people in their everyday lives. As someone with a brother who has special needs, I want to design tools that make communication, collaboration, and learning easier — for him and for others who face similar challenges.</p>

    <p>At Carnegie Mellon, I study Information Systems with plans to minor in Software Engineering and Business. My work focuses on accessible technology, interactive applications, and AI systems that have a tangible positive impact.</p>
