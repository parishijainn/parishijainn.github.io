      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I’m a first-generation American, born in Santa Monica to immigrant parents from India. 
        Their resilience and support shaped my belief in education, persistence, and inclusivity. 
        Today, I’m a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon studying Information Systems, 
        passionate about building technology that empowers, connects, and includes.
      </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Core Values</h2>
        <p>
          I always want people to feel comfortable and supported, whether in a classroom, workplace, or digital space. 
          I believe technology should remove barriers, not create them. My values—<strong>empathy, inclusivity, and clarity</strong>—
          shape how I design, live, and interact with others. They are the compass for my work and life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Family & Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          My mom, a software engineer, inspired me to see being a woman in tech as a strength, 
          not a limitation. My brother, who has special needs, taught me how learning and communication 
          can be adapted with care and creativity. Together, they’ve inspired me to dedicate my career 
          to designing technology that is both innovative and accessible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Identity & Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          Being a woman in a male-dominated field, a first-generation American, and part of a multicultural family 
          gives me a perspective grounded in resilience and empathy. I know what it feels like to be in environments 
          without representation, and I am committed to shaping spaces where diversity and belonging are the norm.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Dance</h2>
        <p>
          I started Indian dance at age four and specialize in <strong>Kathak</strong>. 
          I am certified to teach 3 of 5 levels and plan to continue pursuing certifications. 
          Dance grounds me in discipline, creativity, and storytelling—it’s a lifelong way I stay connected to culture.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Ultimately, my goal is to help shape a future where technology feels personal, empowering, 
        and inclusive—where no one is left behind regardless of their abilities or background.
