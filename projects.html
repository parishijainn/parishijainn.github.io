            Gesture and Gaze Recognition for Accessible Collaborative Environments
          </a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          At CMU’s GRACE initiative, I contribute to research on <strong>gesture and gaze recognition</strong> 
          that enables blind and low-vision (BLV) users to participate fully in collaborative environments. 
          My responsibilities include designing interactive prototypes, running user studies with BLV participants, 
          and analyzing multimodal interaction data to uncover how gaze and gesture can be leveraged as accessible 
          input channels. This work highlights how inclusive design principles can scale to real-world environments.

        <h3>King’s Closet</h3>
        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/AO7PUn8GqX4" target="_blank">Demo</a> | 
           <a href="https://github.com/15-112-s25/prelim-group-92-tp" target="_blank">Code</a></p>
        <p>
          A modern take on Cher Horowitz’s virtual closet from <em>Clueless</em>, 
          this project blends <strong>computer vision, clustering, and interactive design</strong>. 
          I developed a KMeans-based outfit grading system that analyzes color harmony 
          and integrated <strong>gesture controls with MediaPipe</strong> to make browsing outfits feel seamless. 
          The project challenged me to combine playful, pop-culture-inspired design with rigorous 
          algorithms for real-time evaluation and interaction.
        </p>

        <h3>Stellar Sprint</h3>
        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/9dsdgeyWNr8" target="_blank">Demo</a> | 
           <a href="https://github.com/parishijainn/15112TermProject24" target="_blank">Code</a></p>
        <p>
          A <strong>gesture-controlled space adventure</strong> where players pilot a spacecraft through 
          procedurally generated obstacles, adapting to increasing levels of difficulty. 
          I designed dynamic physics-based movement, multiplayer functionality, and a progression system 
          that kept gameplay engaging while ensuring accessibility through intuitive motion controls. 
          This project demonstrated my ability to merge entertainment design with user-centered input systems.

        <h3>NeuralSeek Accessibility Agent</h3>
        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/50ygIdbjuH4" target="_blank">Demo</a></p>
        <p>
          A multi-agent system for <strong>automated accessibility audits</strong> across code, designs, and screenshots. 
          I built modular agents for OCR, static code analysis, and validation against WCAG and Section 508 standards. 
          A shared knowledge base allowed the system to learn from prior audits, making classification more reliable. 
          The project transformed accessibility reviews from hours of manual effort to an automated, explainable workflow.

        <h3>Hack112: 112 Run</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/vaishnavipalas/hack112--112-run" target="_blank">Code</a></p>
        <p>
          An educational game that combines <strong>learning and play</strong>. 
          Players run through procedurally generated paths while solving Python problems, 
          controlled with finger-tracking input. I focused on integrating educational content with 
          engaging mechanics, demonstrating how gamification can motivate learning in a fun, interactive way.
        </p>

        <h3>Duquesne Incline Website Redesign</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/parishijainn/WebDevProject-Duquesne-Incline-Website" target="_blank">Source Code</a></p>
        <p>
          Led a full redesign of the historic Duquesne Incline’s outdated website, 
          emphasizing <strong>responsive design, accessibility, and usability</strong>. 
          Added Google Maps integration, modern form validation, and tested the design with users 
          to confirm that navigation and clarity were improved. This project showed me the impact 
          of design updates on real community-facing services.
